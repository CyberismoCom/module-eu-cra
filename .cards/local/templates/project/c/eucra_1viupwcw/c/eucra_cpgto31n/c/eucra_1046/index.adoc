Compilers typically support many security features and other settings that may impact the security of the product. Therefore, it is important to check that the used compiler settings are secure.

== How to decide if this secure development task is required

This review task is required if the project manages compiled binaries.

This review task must be performed on all binary executable files.

== How to implement

* For executable files compiled by the development team, the analysis can be done by reviewing that secure compiler settings are used in the build chain.
* For executable files that are compiled by a 3rd party organization, the analysis shall be done by analysing the binary with a software composition analysis tool that supports detecting insecure compiler settings.

== How to review this task

Check that the security testing of compiler settings has been planned and executed.

Check that any identified security-related findings have been reported as security issues.
